\chapter{Obtained Experience}
In this semester project, the group has acquired a wide range of knowledge and experiences academically in relation to software for the Rolling Road GUI, embedded software and hardware. We have been very interdisciplinary between our electronical solutions and the mechanical parts the mechanical engineering students have been working on. This partnership with the mechanical engineering students has left us with an impression of how real engineers work interdisciplinary with other engineers from other academic disciplines. This semester project has been larger than any other semester project that we have experienced so far, with assignments of the RollingRoad, the corresponding GUI and the AU2-SEM2016 all in one semester project. Because of this, Scrum has made the many tasks easier to grasp. The "stand up" meetings in Scrum has positively oriented the members of the group about what has been executed this week, what still needs to be done and if harder problems arise in a task, so these problems can be solved as quick as possible.
