Over the course of this project, i have gained experience developing in the WPF-framework, since it was used to developed the Rolling Road GUI. While developing the GUI, a lot of unit-tests was written to ensure functionality, so i also gained a lot experience in designing testable-software and writing the tests themselves. The GUI is also one of the largest projects i have worked on, with a code base of ~1800 lines of code divided over 7 sub-projects, giving me a better understanding of what's needed to manage a project of this size.
