Over the course of this project, i have gained experience developing in the WPF-framework, since it was used to developed the Rolling Road GUI. While developing the GUI, a lot of unit-tests was written to ensure functionality, so i also gained a lot experience in designing testable-software and writing the tests themselves. \fxnote{JH}
