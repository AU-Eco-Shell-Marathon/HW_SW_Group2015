I have been working a lot in between of electrical and mechanical word. In the work with Rolling Road and MCU. It has give me lot of experience how to work with mechanical tings as DC-motors and have gained a good overview of how the two worlds work together. Both then I should make the LUT where I have to leaned to use efficiency diagram to build one. And in the process of Rolling Road, where a lot of calculation and simulation has to be made between the mechanical and electrical world. 
Of cause has I also leaned a lot of other things, like setting up a DMA and other small things. The project it self has been an interesting experience, even though the car was not finished.
