I have been working a lot in between of electrical and mechanical in the work with Rolling Road and MCU. It has give me lot of experience how to work with mechanical tings as DC-motors and have gain a got overview of how the two worlds work together. Both then I should make the LUT where I have to leaned to use efficiency diagram to build one. And in the process of Rolling Road a lot of calculation and simulation has to been made between the mechanical and electrical world. To make sure 


The project has also give other experience 

It has been an experience to work with a project like this. My focus in this project have mainly been on the Rolling Road. Where I have to work with mechanical forced  

It has been an experience to work with a project like this. Gained a lot of experience working with DC-motors mainly beacuse my main focus has been on the Rolling Road

 in half electrical and mechanical
