\section{Laimonas I. Bendikas}
I have managed to attain an extensive amount of knowledge pertaining to the course of the 4. semester project. This knowledge includes, however, is not limited to great hardware and software interpretation, debugging and reverse engineering experience. \\
A majority of the time I have been working with the Battery Management System, which proved to be a great travail. A handful of students have worked with the BMS between 2013 and 2014. In that lapse of time many changes were committed to the BMS, however, many of those have not been documented at all. This led to many problems arising during the term......


to do...

Documentation needs

Reverse engineering

Debugging (HW/SW) with no documentation
