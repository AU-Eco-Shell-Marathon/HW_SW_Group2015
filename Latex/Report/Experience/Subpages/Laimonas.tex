\section{Laimonas I. Bendikas}
I have managed to attain an extensive amount of knowledge pertaining to the course of the 4. semester project. This knowledge includes, however, is not limited to great hardware and software interpretation, debugging and reverse engineering experience.\\
A majority of the time I have been working with the Battery Management System, which proved to be a great struggle. A lot of time was spent reading the previous documentation and understanding the system. On top of that we were supposed to provide duplicate prints for the system - prints were not done due to us not participating in SEM, however it took a lot of time to find fitting components for the new prints.\\
A handful of students worked with the BMS between 2013 and 2014 and in that lapse of time many changes were committed to the BMS, however, many of those have not been documented at all. This was very frustrating when problems started arising during the semester. It made it very difficult to debug the system and a lot of reverse engineering had to be done due to that fact.\\
Therefore I've experienced first hand how it is extremely important to have an eminently well documented documentation when working with big systems. And this led me to acknowledge how important an engineers work is when it comes to documenting their work and explaining a system's capabilities. Every last detail has to be written down so that no one will be in doubt when trying to comprehend it.
