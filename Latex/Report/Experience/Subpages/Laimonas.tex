\section{Laimonas I. Bendikas}
I have managed to attain an extensive amount of knowledge pertaining to the course of the 4. semester project. This knowledge includes, however, is not limited to great hardware and software interpretation, debugging and reverse engineering experience.\\
A majority of the time I have been working with the Battery Management System, which proved to be a great struggle. A lot of time was spent reading the previous documentation and understanding the system. On top of that we were supposed to provide duplicate prints for the system - prints were not done due to us not participating in SEM, however it took a lot of time to find fitting components for the new prints.\\
A handful of students worked with the BMS between 2013 and 2014 and in that lapse of time many changes were committed to the BMS, however, many of those have not been documented at all. This was very frustrating when problems started arising during the semester. It made it very difficult to debug the system and a lot of reverse engineering had to be done due to that fact.\\
Therefore I've experienced first hand how it is extremely important to have an eminently well documented documentation when working with big systems. And this led me to acknowledge how important an engineers work is when it comes to documenting their work and explaining a system's capabilities. Every last detail has to be written down so that no one will be in doubt when trying to comprehend it. 

\textbf{Digital Unit}\\
The Digital Unit handles the measured values from the Analog Front End to run calculations and approximations of cell conditions. If any conditions exceed a specific threshold then the Digital Unit is capable of isolating, and therefore protect, the Propulsion Batteries by utilizing the Isolation Switch.

\textbf{Analog Front End}\\
The purpose of the Analog Front End is that it collects data of the Propulsion Batteries' cell voltages, Propulsion Batteries' temperature and the Current Sensor. Furthermore, this unit transmits all the gathered data to the Digital Unit, who in return can request cell balancing. 

\textbf{Analog Front End Extension Module}\\
The Extension Module's purpose is that it gives the BMS the capability to utilize more than one battery.

\textbf{Isolation Switch}\\
The Isolation Switch governs and protects the Propulsion Batteries by having the possibility of isolating them on command from the Analog Front End via the Digital Unit. 

\textbf{DC/DC Converter}\\
The DC/DC Converter converts the Propulsion Batteries' high voltage to a lower voltage that is then usable by the Digital unit and the components it contains.

\textbf{Current Sensor}\\
The Current Sensor can measure the amount of current flowing through the it by using a pair of shunt resistors. 

\textbf{Propulsion Batteries}\\
The Propulsion Batteries delivers electrical energy to supply the Propulsion Motor contained in the Motor Control System as well as the rest of the systems in AU2.
