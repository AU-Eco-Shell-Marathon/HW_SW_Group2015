\section{Jens P. Nymann}
One of my responsibilities as the project leader has been coordinating meetings and information with the mechanical engineering students. This interdisciplinary partnership has been very exciting, but also time consuming. My main workload has lied in the Battery Management System(BMS). I have, with the BMS, experienced first hand how frustrating it is to work with a system where documentation is missing. I have therefore learned a lot about how to debug and try to reverse engineer the changes that had not yet been documented.
