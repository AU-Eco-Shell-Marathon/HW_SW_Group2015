\section{AU2}
Requirements for AU2 have been created with SEM2016 Global Rules Chapter 1 in mind\fxnote{SEM2016 Global Rules Chapter 1}. (Chapter 1 is the academical chapter of the race, with the academical rules and announcements). These requirements consists of non-functional requirements such as the pitch of tone the horn must emit when the AU2 car overtakes another car, or that the Motor Control System(MCS) must be able to measure the velocity within a range of 0-30 km/h and with a precision of $\pm$2 km/h. These non-functional requirements can be found in the AU2 documentation\fxnote{documentation AU2 section 2.2}. The requirements also consists of functional requirements such as the Battery Management System(BMS) must be able to protect the battery from undervoltages, overvoltages, overcurrents, too high temperatures and it must also be able to balance the battery cells if these individual voltages are too different compared to eachother. A tabel with all the functional requirements can be found in the AU2 documentation\fxnote{documentation AU2 section 2.1}. CAN-communication between the BMS, the MCS and a PC, is not a requirement from the SEM2016 Rules, but it is an extra requirement that has been made, since this will make it possible to send the data from the BMS to the MCS while driving and save this to a SDcard that can be inserted into a PC.

\section{Rolling Road}
Requirements for the Rolling Road can be found in the Rolling Road documentation\fxnote{documentation Rolling Road requirements}.
These requirements consists of non-functional requirements such as the range of the voltages the tested motor is supplied with must be from 0-50 V, the settling time being 100ms, the maximum overshoot being 5\% and a maximum current through the Load System of 15 A.\\
Where as the functional requirements are about how the Rolling Road operates such as the Rolling Road must be able to apply a constant force, but also must be able to change the desired force exerted to the subject. The Rolling Road must also be able to measure power, speed and force, and also calculate the efficiency of the subject and more.
