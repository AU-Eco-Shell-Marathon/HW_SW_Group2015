\section{AU2}
Requirements for AU2 have been created with SEM2016 Global Rules Chapter 1 in mind\fxnote{SEM2016 Global Rules Chapter 1}. (Chapter 1 is the academical chapter of the race, with the academical rules and announcements). These requirements consists of non-functional requirements such as the pitch of tone the horn must emit when the AU2 car overtakes another car, or that the Motor Control System must be able to measure the velocity within a range of 0-30 km/h and with a precision of $\pm$2 km/h. These non-functional requirements can be found in the documentation\fxnote{documentation BMS section 2.2}. The requirements also consists of functional requirements such as the Battery Management System must be able to protect the battery from undervoltages, overvoltages, overcurrents, too high temperatures and it must also be able to balance the battery cells if these individual voltages are too different compared to eachother. A tabel with all the functional requirements can be found in the documentation\fxnote{documentation BMS section 2.1}.
