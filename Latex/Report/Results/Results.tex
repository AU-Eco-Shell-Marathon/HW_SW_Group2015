\chapter{Results}
AU2 has not attained an acceptable result because several most of the accept was not approved because of errors with the Battery Management System. To solve these problems a lot of debugging has already been performed, though to no avail. Possible approaches at this stage could have been to buy a commercially available  BMS that could support at least 12 cells. If certain requirements are not met by the bought BMS then those would have to be implemented to be able to compete in the SEM. That is a very costly and time consuming option, however, another solution could have been to buy the original developer of the BMS 2013 to consult the BMS team on the matter. These approaches were chosen to be evaluated after the hand-in of the project documentation and report, however, since participation in the SEM 2016 was cancelled none of them were selected\fxnote{other failed accepttest things can be added from the MCS}.

The Rolling Road has attained an acceptable result because of the fact that it completed most\fxnote{could use feedback on the individual parts / do acceptest before this be completed to see results} of the accept test without major problems. nonetheless, optimization could be done on ... \fxnote{failed parts / sensors etc. need status wednesday to complete}.

The Rolling Road GUI has reached a satisfying degree given the fact that it works seamlessly with or without the Rolling Road. Optimization can however be performed on several areas ... \fxnote{possible things to note - not to be confused with future work}.
