\section{Software BMS}
Since the assignment was to understand the BMS, researching the system was initiated. When the group felt comfortable with the inputs and outputs of the system, small tests were executed to see if the BMS still worked as promised. The results of the tests were that the temperature measurements and the cell voltages and current measurements worked as expected, but the CAN-communication did not. The test of the temperature, voltages and current can be seen on figure\vref{fig:SOFTWARE_REPORT_BMS}.\\

After trying to fix the CAN-communication, tests were executed. Here it was found out that the software for the Battery Management System that was given was the outdated 2013 version, which only works for a 6 celled battery. The 2014 version that was used with 12 cells was found in the end. There was no documentation for the software, so the group has reverse engineered the software to document the changes made in 2014, see the documentation\cite{AU2} (section 5.4).\\
The CAN-communication could not be tested because of hardware problems. \fxnote{Laimonas er du enig?}
