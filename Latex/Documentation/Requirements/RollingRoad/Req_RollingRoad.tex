\section{Rolling Road}
This section gives an overview over the requirements for the Rolling Road. The description Rolling Road covers both the mechanically build system and the implemented hardware. 

\subsection{Functional requirements}
Table \ref{Functional:Rolling Road} will provide the functional requirements for the Rolling Road.

	\begin{tabular}{|p{2 cm}|p{7 cm}|p{4 cm}|}
	\hline
	\textbf{(Req. \#)} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Comments} \\\hline
	RR\_F1	& Must be able to measure the power from the battery and the torque given to the generator. &   \\\hline
	RR\_F2	& Must be able to regulate the torque of the generator &   \\\hline
	RR\_F3	& Must be able to communicate with a PC &   \\\hline
	RR\_F4	& Must be able to display the results collected on a GUI & For more info, see \ref{sec:rollingroadgui}  \\\hline
	\end{tabular}
