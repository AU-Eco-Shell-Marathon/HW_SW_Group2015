\chapter{Requirements}
In order to qualify for participation in the Shell Eco-Marathon the system must fullfill certain specified requirements. These specifications are made by the committee behind Shell Eco-Marathon. 

Due to the participation in the Eco-Marathon, this product will be a working unit, not only a mere prototype. This gives some extra work, where all the devices must be thoroughly tested and must be functional under many differently circumstances. Furthermore all circuits will be stress-tested. Interconnectors between circuits must be safely secured, so that wires won't dislocate during driving.
