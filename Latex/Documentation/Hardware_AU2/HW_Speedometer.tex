\section{Speedometer}
In order for the motor controller to control the vehicle properly it must know the vehicle's current speed. This is done by implementing a speedometer.

\subsection{Design}
The speedometer is designed using a HAL-sensor of the type TLE49X5L and 5 magnets. The magnets are applied to the spokes of the back-wheel.
