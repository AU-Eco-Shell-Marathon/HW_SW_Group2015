\subsection{Protocol description}
The signals and protocols used to communicate between the blocks are specified in this section.

\textbf{Block :Power sensor}\\
The Power sensor receives power from the external power source (battery). Signals representing the voltage and current emit from the Power sensor as voltage 0-5V.\\
Block interface description:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{:power}\\

	\item \textbf{Power\_V :power}\\
		Direction: [Power sensor] $\rightarrow$ [Control unit]\\
		Description: An analog signal in the interval 0-5V, which represents the voltage of the power received from the external power source.
	\item \textbf{Power\_I: voltage}\\
		Direction: [Power sensor] $\rightarrow$ [Control unit]\\
		Description: An XXX signal in the interval 0-5V, which represents the current of the power received from the external power source.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Block :Wheel}\\
