\chapter{Introduction}
This document contains the documentation for two systems which this group has worked on during this project. The systems are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{AU2}\\
		An electrically propulsed car which has been build in collaboration with a group mechanical engineers in order to compete in the Shell Eco-Marathon. The vehicle has been built by the specifications set by Shell.
	\item{Rolling Road}\\
		A dynamometer which has been built to test the performance of AU2. In order to show the collected data visually the system communicates with a PC where a GUI has been implemented.
\end{itemize}

Some of the subsystems in AU2 and Rolling Road had already been built, documented and implemented by the start of this project. In order to understand these systems, the reader is encouraged to read the matching documentation, as this documentation will keep information about them to a minimum.
