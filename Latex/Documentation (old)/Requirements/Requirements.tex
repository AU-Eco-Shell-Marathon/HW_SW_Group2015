\chapter{Requirements}
Due to the participation in the Eco-Marathon, this product will be a working unit, not only a mere prototype. This gives some extra work, where all the devices must be thoroughly tested and must be functional under many differently circumstances. All circuits and all software must be tested, thoroughly enough to ensure stability under every condition. 

This testing will include testing the maximum and minimum limits of the systems. Not just safely within their operating zones. 
Interconnectors between circuits must be safely secured, so that wires will not dislocate during driving.

The functional and non-functional requirements are labeled such that they can easily be referenced later on in the documentation.
