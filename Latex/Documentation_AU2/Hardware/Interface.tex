\section{Interface}
The interface gives the user, here the driver, an opportunity to coomunicate with the system. This gives the driver some form of control over the operation of the vehicle. Furthermore it ensures the driver has the ability to use the horn and to keep the dead man safety switch activated as stated by the requirements.

The interface also includes the  connections to the CAN transceiver and the SDcard interface.
