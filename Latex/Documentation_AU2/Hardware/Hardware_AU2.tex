\chapter{Hardware}
This chapter deals with the internal hardware structure of the system as well as the unity test of the specified blocks.

All the hardware that is self developed is placed onto a PCB that is designed in Ultiboard. 

Modules included on the PCB is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Horn}
	\item{Distribution Block}
	\item{Motor Controller Unit}
	\item{Speedometer}
	\item{Interface}
	\item{Motor Controller}
	\item{Measurements}
	\item{SDcard}
	\item{CAN-transceiver}
\end{itemize}

The remaining modules are either in a separate case or delivered by Shell Eco Marathon.
