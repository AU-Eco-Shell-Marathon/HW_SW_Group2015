\section{CAN-Transceiver}
The CAN-transceiver is in place to ensure a proper transmission of the CAN signal. Even though the microcrontroller, used as MCU, contains a CAN controller it is still needed to implement a CAN transceiver, according to the protocol.

The CAN bus is used to communicate with BMS and a computer that can be connected to this.   

\subsection{Design}
There exists numerous CAN transceiver packages that can be used for this specific purpose. The specific transceiver
