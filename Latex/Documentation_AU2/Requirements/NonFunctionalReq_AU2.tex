		\hline
		\textbf{Req. \#} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Comments} \\\hline
		AU2\_NF1	& The horn must emit a sound equal or louder than 85 dBa when measured 4 meters horizontally from the vehicle. &	\\\hline
		AU2\_NF2	& The tone emitted by the horn must have a pitch between 420 Hz and 420 kHz. &	\\\hline
		AU2\_NF3	& The voltage from the battery must not exceed 48 V nominal and 60 V maximum. &	\\\hline
		AU2\_NF4	& The capacity of the battery must not exceed 1,000 Wh. &	\\\hline
		AU2\_NF5	& The Motor Control Unit must be able to measure the vehicle's velocity within a 0-30 km/h range and with a precision of $\pm$2 km/h. &	\\\hline
		AU2\_NF6	& There must be backups for all PCBs used in AU2. And at least two sets of batteries and motors. So that if something breaks it is fast to install a working backup version. &	\\\hline
		AU2\_NF7	& The battery must be placed on a metal tray in order to prevent an eventual battery-fire that would damage the system. &   \\\hline
		AU2\_NF8	& The positive and negative circuits of the propulsion battery must be electrically isolated from the vehicle frame. &   \\\hline
		AU2\_NF9	& The battery must be installed outside the cockpit behind a bulk head. &   \\\hline
