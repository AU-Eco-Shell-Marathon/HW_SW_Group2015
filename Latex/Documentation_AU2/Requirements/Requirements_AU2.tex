In order for the vehicle to qualify for participation in the Shell Eco-Marathon the system must fulfil certain specified requirements. The specifications that are made by the committee behind Shell Eco-Marathon are included, since these are the most important requirements. Furthermore communication between the Motor Controller System, the BMS and a PC is included for measured data-logging. The requirements will be organized in non-functional and functional requirements as known from earlier semester projects.

The group is working together with a team of mechanical engineering students, who are building the non-electronic parts of the car. It is paramount that both teams cooperate for a successful project. The cooperation should therefore also be reviewed as an indirect requirement for this project on pair with the other requirements.
