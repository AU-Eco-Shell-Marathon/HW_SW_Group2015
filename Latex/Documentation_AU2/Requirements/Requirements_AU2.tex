In order for the vehicle to qualify for participation in the Shell Eco-Marathon the system must fullfill certain specified requirements. The specifications that are made by the committee behind Shell Eco-Marathon are of course included, since this is the most important requirements. Furthermore communication between the motorcontroller, the BMS system and a PC is included for measured data-logging. The requirements will be organized in non-functional and functional requirements as known from earlier semester projects. \\
The group must work together with a group of mechanical engineering students who build the non-electronic parts of the car. For both groups to cooperate with eachother is paramount to make this project a success. And the cooperation should therefore also be reviewed as an indirect requirement for this project on pair with the other requirements.\\
