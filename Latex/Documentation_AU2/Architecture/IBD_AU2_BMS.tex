\section{Internal Block Diagram - BMS}
Due to the complexity of the Battery Management System its interconnectivity has been visualized on a separate Internal Block Diagram. The result is seen below.

\section{Signal description - BMS}
The signals and protocols used to communicate between the blocks in BMS are specified in this section.

\textbf{Block :BMS}\\
Block interface description:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ShutDown:Voltage}\\
	Direction: [External] $\rightarrow$ [Analog Front End]\\
	Description: Shuts down the system if a change in the voltage-level is measured from 48 V to 0 V. This happens when the corresponding Emergency Shutdown Switch is pressed.
	\item \textbf{MainSupply:Power}\\
	Direction: [Analog Front End] $\rightarrow$ [External]\\
	Description: The power from the battery which is delivered through the relay in the Analog Front End to the remaining electrical systems in the car. 
	\item \textbf{BMSC:CAN}\\
	Direction: [External] $\leftrightarrow$ [Digital Unit]\\
	Description: CAN-communication with a computer in order to gain information about various variables.
	\item \textbf{BatterySupplyA:Power}\\
	Direction: [External] $\rightarrow$ [Current Sensor]\\
