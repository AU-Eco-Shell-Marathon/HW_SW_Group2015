\section{Internal Block Diagram - MCS}
As with the Battery Management System, the Motor Control System (MCS) is too complex to be represented propely on a IBD along with the rest of the systems. The complexity has instead been visualized on a separate Internal Block Diagram. The result is seen below.

	\label{fig:IBD_MCS}
\end{figure}

It should be noted that each of the blocks in the MCS is connected with the signal called 'SupplyMCS:Voltage' which supplies every block in MCS with 5 V. This signal has been omitted from the IBD to increase the simplicity.
