\section{Signal description - AU2}
The signals and protocols used to communicate between the blocks in AU2 are specified in this section. These are only descriptions for the signals contained in the IBD for AU2.

\textbf{Block :AU2}\\
Block interface description:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{HornOn:Force}\\
	Direction: [External] $\rightarrow$ [Horn]\\
