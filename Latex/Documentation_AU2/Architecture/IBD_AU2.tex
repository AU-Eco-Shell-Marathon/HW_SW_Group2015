\section{Internal Block Diagram - AU2}
The IBD on \ref{fig:IBD} shows the internal connection between the blocks described in the BBD. As both BMS and MCU are large and complicated blocks, they are treated as single blocks. The internal connections of these systems are described in their own sections and the IBD below should only be used to gain a general overview of the system's internal connectivity.
