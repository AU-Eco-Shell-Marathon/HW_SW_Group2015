This section gives an overview over the requirements for the Rolling Road. The functional and non-functional requirements are labeled such that they can easily be referenced later on in the documentation.

These requirements are solely for the electrically developed system for the dynamometer. All requirements regarding the mechanical system can be found in the previous documentation\cite{BAC_rullefelt}.
