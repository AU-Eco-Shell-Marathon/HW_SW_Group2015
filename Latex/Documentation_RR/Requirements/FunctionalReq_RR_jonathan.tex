		\hline
		\textbf{Req. \#} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Comments} \\\hline
		RR\_F1
		& The system must be able to hold a constant force on the subject.
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F2
		& The system must be able to change the desired force exerted on the subject. 
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F3
		& The system must turn off the Load System if the current through it becomes too big (overcurrent specified in RR\_NF3).
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F4
		& The system must be able to measure the power of the subject on test.
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F5
		& The system must be able to measure force and speed of the subject on test, (to find the mechanical force). \fxnote{Det i parentes er vel ligegyldigt - TN}
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F6
		& The system must be able to calculate the efficiency of the subject on test. 
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F7
		& The system must be able to adjust Rolling Road's sensor and set them all to zero. 
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F8
		& The Load System must be controlled with a PID-regulator.
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F9
		& The PID-regulator must have anti windup. \fxnote{Er det n√∏dvendigt at have med som krav? - TN}
		&  \\ \hline
		RR\_F10
		& The system must be able to remember settings after shutdown. Settings which Rolling Road must remember: PID-constants, desired force and offset values of all sensors. \fxnote{Omformuler! - TN}
