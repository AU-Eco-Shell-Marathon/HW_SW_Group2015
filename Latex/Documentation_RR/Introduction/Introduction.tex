\chapter{Introduction}
This documentation contains information about the specifications, design, architecture and functionality of the dynamometer named Rolling Road. The system is designed with the goal of testing the performance of the electrically propulsed car AU2.

\section{System description}
The purpose of this system is to measure the performance of an electrically propulsed car. More specifically this system has been designed with AU2 in mind. The performance is tested by placing the car on the dynamometer and connecting the car's battery to the measurement-system.

The car's performance is measured as the amount of electrical power from the battery which is converted to mechanical power. The performance-data can be sent to the "NAME OF GUI"\fxnote{name of GUI} where a user can view them graphically.

Furthermore the user is able to change the size the load on the dynamometer and thus increasing the amount of torque required to move it. This is also done using the "NAME OF GUI".
