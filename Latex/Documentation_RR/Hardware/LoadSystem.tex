\section{Load System}
The purpose of this block is to measure the electrical current generated by the Generator and to control the amount of power delivered to a load.

Due to the complexity of the Load System it's design, implementation and unit test is split according to the IBD below. It should be noted that the Load and the Super Capacitor is located on the Load-plate which.
