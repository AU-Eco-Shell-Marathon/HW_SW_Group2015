\section{Load System}
The purpose of this block is to measure the electrical current generated by the Generator in order to control the amount of power delivered to a load.

Due to the complexity of the Load System it's design, implementation and unit test is split according to the IBD below. It should be noted that the Load and the Super Capacitor is located on the Load-plate which is separated from the remaining system.

\end{figure}

A short explanation for each subsystem seen in the Load System's IBD is given below. A more detailed explanation for each subsystem is given in the subsequent sections.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Load}\\
	A passive load which converts generated electrical energy to thermic energy (heat).
	\item \textbf{Current Sensor}\\
	A current transducer which measures the current produced by the Generator's generated voltage in order to control the system using a PID-controller.
	\item \textbf{Super Capacitor}\\
	A capacitor which will counter the inductive reactance of the Generator in order to prevent current-transients.
	\item \textbf{MOSFET \& Driver}\\
	A power MOSFET (and an associated MOSFET-driver) which controls the amount of current delivered to the Load.
