\section{Load System}
\label{sec:LoadSystem}
The purpose of this block is to measure the electrical current generated by the Generator in order to control the amount of power delivered to a load.

Due to the complexity of the Load System it's design, implementation and unit test is split according to the IBD below. It should be noted that the Load and the Super Capacitor is located on the Load-plate which is separated from the remaining system.

\end{figure}

A short explanation for each subsystem seen in the Load System's IBD is given below. A more detailed explanation for each subsystem is given in the subsequent sections.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Load}\\
	A passive load which converts generated electrical energy to thermic energy (heat).
	\item \textbf{Current Sensor}\\
	A current transducer which measures the current produced by the Generator's generated voltage in order to control the system using a PID-controller.
	\item \textbf{Super Capacitor}\\
	A capacitor which will counter the inductive reactance of the Generator in order to prevent current-transients.
	\item \textbf{MOSFET \& Driver}\\
	A power MOSFET (and an associated MOSFET-driver) which controls the amount of current delivered to the Load.

\subsection{Implementation}
The individual designs from the previous sections are used to design the complete Load System. This subsystem differs from other subsystems in Rolling Road due to the fact that some parts of the subsystem is located inside the Control-box and other parts are on the Load-plate. The circuit inside the Control-box is seen in the diagram below:

	\caption{Complete Load System implemented on the Control-box}
	\label{fig:LoadSystemCircuit}
\end{figure}

The Super Capacitor and the Load are placed on the Load-plate due to the size of the components. The Control-box and the Load-plate can be connected using banana-plugs which are color-coded for simplicity. The diagram above and below are made such that the 3-plug-connectors should be connected by lining them up.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Unity test}
The Load System hasn't had a unity test since this was done in the Previous System\cite{BAC_rullefelt} and the system implemented in Rolling Road is identical. For a complete unity test of the Load System, the reader is referred to the related documentation on page 74 to 77.
