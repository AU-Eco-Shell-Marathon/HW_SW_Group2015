\textbf{Noise reduction in velocity-signal}\\
The output-signal for the measured angular velocity lies between the $0$ to $+5 V$ range and can therefore be measured correctly by the PSoC without rescaling. However, the electrical noise in the signal must be reduced, in order to let the PSoC measure correctly.

The noise can be reduced with a low-pass filter, but if it is assumed that the amplitude of the noise is low enough it can also be reduced using a comparator with hysteresis. This comparator must be fast enough to convert the signal and the highest frequency of the velocity-signal must be calculated.

From the analysis of the Generator it was found that the rolls angular velocity $\omega_{Roll}$ is equal to 1047 rpm - when AU2 runs at cruise speed (maximum velocity). This velocity will create a velocity-signal with the highest frequency. This frequency can be found as:
\begin{equation}
	f_{v} = 360 \frac{pulses}{rotation} \cdot \frac{\omega_{Roll}}{60\frac{seconds}{minutes}} = \SI{6.282}{\kilo \hertz}
\end{equation}
