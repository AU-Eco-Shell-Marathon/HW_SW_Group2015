\section{Signal Converter}
The primary purpose of this block is to convert the output from the Torque Sensor to a signal which can be correctly measured by the Control Unit.

\subsection{Design}
The torque-signal and the velocity-signal from the Torque Sensor are measured by the PSoC using different techniques and the Signal Converter must therefore be in charge of three different signal-processing techniques: Rescaling the torque-signal and reduce the noise in the velocity-signal.

\input{Hardware/SignalConverter/Velocity}

\subsection{Implementation}
The designs from the previous section is implemented using a non-inverting adder and two schmitt-triggers in series.

\textbf{Non-inverting adder}\\
The circuit is built using a MCP601 operational amplifier. Its positive and negative supply lines are connected with 5 VDC and ground. The op-amps positive power supply is parallel-connected with a capacitor. This capacitor improves the op-amps high-frequency response.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Schmitt-trigger}\\
The noise reduction is implemented using two 74HC14 hex inverter with Schmitt-trigger inputs. The inverter creates a small propagation delay between the Torque Sensor's output and the PSoC's input. At a 5VDC power supply this delay is given by:
\begin{equation}
	t_{pd} = t_{PHL} = t_{PLH} = \SI{24}{\nano \second}
\end{equation}

	\caption{Typical inverter-waveform}
	\label{fig:SchmittTrigger_waveform}
\end{figure}

In order to counter the inverting property of 74HC14, and create a comperator, the noise reduction  must consist of two Schmitt-triggers in series. This gives the subsystem a total propagation delay of $\SI{24}{\nano \second}$. As the 74HC14 contains six Schmitt-triggers the 4 unused Schmitt-trigger's inputs are connected to ground in order to prevent unwanted oscilliation.
