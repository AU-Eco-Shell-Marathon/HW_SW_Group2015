\section{Signal Converter}
The primary purpose of this block is to convert the output from the Torque Sensor to a signal which can be correctly measured by the Control Unit.

\subsection{Design}
The torque-signal and the velocity-signal from the Torque Sensor are measured by the PSoC using different techniques and the Signal Converter must therefore be in charge of two different signal-processing techniques: Rescaling the torque-signal and reducing the noise in the velocity-signal.

\subsection{Implementation}
The designs from the previous section is implemented using a non-inverting adder and two schmitt-triggers in series.

\textbf{Non-inverting adder}\\
The circuit is built using a MCP6004 I/P operational amplifier. Its positive and negative supply lines are connected with 5 VDC and ground. The op-amps positive power supply is connected in parallel with a $\SI{100}{\nano \farad}$ capacitor. This capacitor improves the op-amps high-frequency response. The final design is seen on Figure \vref{fig:SignalConverterTorque3}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Schmitt-trigger}\\
The noise reduction is implemented using two 74HC14 hex inverter with Schmitt-trigger inputs. The inverter creates a small propagation delay between the Torque Sensor's output and the PSoC's input. At a 5 VDC power supply this delay is given by:
\begin{equation}
	t_{pd} = t_{PHL} = t_{PLH} = \SI{24}{\nano \second}
\end{equation}
Which means that if the ADC in the PSoC samples input signals with a frequency greater than $\SI{41.67}{\mega \hertz}$ then the resulting samples are gonna be displaced one sample compared to the velocity-samples.

\end{figure}

In order to counter the inverting property of 74HC14, and create a comperator, the noise reduction  must consist of two Schmitt-triggers in series. This gives the subsystem a total propagation delay of $\SI{24}{\nano \second}$. As the 74HC14 contains six Schmitt-triggers the 4 unused Schmitt-trigger's inputs are connected to ground in order to prevent unwanted oscilliation. The subsystem's final design is seen on Figure \ref{fig:SignalConverterVelocity} below.
