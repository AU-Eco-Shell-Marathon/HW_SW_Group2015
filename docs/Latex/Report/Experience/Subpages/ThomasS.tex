\section{Thomas S. Rasmussen}
The experience i have obtained during this project has differed from previous experiences, as most of the work i've done i've done has been in the form of reverse-engineering previous systems. This is not a new discipline for me, but i've never done it with a system of the size of either Zenith33 nor the dynamometer.

One of the things i found most helpful was the sections containing the previous system's architecture. I've worked with BDDs and IBDs before - but mostly in the form of being presented to a system and then 'translating' it into a SysML-diagram. This time it was the other way around. This helped me see how important a coherent architecture is to the reader - i.e. someone who has no prior knowledge to the systems workings.

Due to the size of both AU2 and Rolling Road it became clear to me, over the course of the project, that the workload was simply to big for a 6-man team. It was also very hard to keep an overview over both systems using only bi-weekly SCRUM-meetings.
