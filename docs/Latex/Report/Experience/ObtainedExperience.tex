\chapter{Obtained Experience}
In this semester project, the group has acquired a wide range of knowledge and experiences academically in relation to software for the Rolling Road GUI, embedded software as well as hardware for AU2 and the Rolling Road. We have been very interdisciplinary when discussing electronic solutions along with the mechanical parts that the mechanical engineering students have been working on. The partnership with the mechanical engineering students has left us with an impression of how engineers have to work interdisciplinary with other engineers across various academic backgrounds. This semester project has been bigger and more complex than any other semester project that we have experienced so far. With the assignments ranging from the Rolling Road to the corresponding GUI as well as the AU2 all in one semester project. With respects to this SCRUM has made the heavy assignment burden easier to grasp. The stand-up meetings in SCRUM have positively oriented the members of the group at the time with completed assignments during a week. Including work that still needed attention and if more difficult problems would arise then those could be solved as quickly as possible.
